# 🛡️ CyberGuard

**CyberGuard** is a live cybersecurity threat monitoring dashboard that aggregates and correlates data from multiple threat intelligence feeds into a single, real-time view.

It is designed to help security teams quickly identify malicious indicators, track emerging threats, and improve situational awareness across their environment.

> ⚠️ Status: Actively in development. Features, architecture, and APIs are subject to change.

### 🚀 Overview

CyberGuard pulls threat intelligence from multiple open and commercial sources — such as:

- AbuseDB
- AlientVault OTX
- Virus Total
- *(Additional feeds planned)*

These signals are normalized, enriched, and presented through a unified dashboard for rapid investigation and response.

### 📦 Installation
